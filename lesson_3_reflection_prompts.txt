Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We may not want to make each commit public as it might still be in a developmental stage.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches used to create a new version.
Clones used to copy repository from github to local machine.
Forks used to copy repository from one github a/c to another.
