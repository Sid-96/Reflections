Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We may not want to make each commit public as it might still be in a developmental stage.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches used to create a new version.
Clones used to copy repository from github to local machine.
Forks used to copy repository from one github a/c to another.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It can be used to merge a commit made on github directly.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
More storage efficient, but more complicated. But I would definitely use Git VCS.
